🧬 Reactor

Reactor is a lightweight, React-based SPWA (Single Page Wallet Application) designed for the LSD (Liquid State Dollar) ecosystem. While it starts as a decentralized wallet, Reactor evolves into a mesh node interface — acting as a logic-sharing hub for symbolic operations (MorphOps) across a distributed device network.

Powered by ZetaMorph and managed through Neurom Protocol, Reactor turns every device into a collaborative processing unit in the emerging post-logic computational paradigm.


---

🚀 Purpose

Reactor is not just a wallet — it’s the entry point into the mesh.

🌐 Handles LSD balances via symbolic math (ZetaMorph engine)

🔄 Sends/receives MorphOps between devices via Neurom

🧠 Will eventually route, receive, and execute logic fragments across mesh-connected devices

🧱 Becomes the modular GUI shell for Chronos OS applications in future phases

MODULES-
WATCHER Collects Proof of Morph
WEAVER Creates POM Package for Contract
ZM No GPU Math Engine

🔁 MorphOps Dispatch Sends and receives morph operations
🗂️ Skeleton Sync Manages device’s symbolic skeleton (wallet balance and state)
🧪 Testing P2P Early-stage experiments with device-to-device logic sharing
⚙️ Minimal React Core Built with lightweight, SPWA-first principles

🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/LEXICALALCHEMIST/Reactor
cd Reactor

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

3. Start development server:

npm start

App will launch at http://localhost:3000 or your local network IP if available.

🧠 How It Works

1. Reactor connects to Neurom, registering its MorphID and device location.


2. Reactor can send/receive symbolic math operations (MorphOps) — PUSH and PULL — to and from other users.


3. All operations are executed without GPU, using symbolic state mutation via ZetaMorph.


4. In the background, Reactor starts functioning as a mesh-aware node, ready to route and share logic on demand.


5. Future versions will allow compressed logic payloads, function fracturing, and dynamic app cards without app installs.
